		<h2>How donations are used</h2> <!-- Split into two parts to demonstrate Competition and Prep -->
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Robotics Competition</h3>

			<p>Through our Robotics Competition program, we are able to provide robotics kits, parts, and mentors for 24 teams. Our includes:</p>

			<ul class="donations">
				<li>Competition Field Construction</li>
				<li>Campus-mandated insurance</li>
				<li>Room reservation fees</li>
				<li>Funding for mentor transportation to school campuses</li>
				<li>Tools available to teams when working on the UC Berkeley campus</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We ask teams for only a $100 entry fee in order to ensure that money is not a barrier to entry. Our budget is extremely efficient and cost-effective compared to most robotics competitions, which often require each team to spend thousands of dollars.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>PREP</h3>

			<p>Our PREP program provides weekly engaging, hands-on learning experiences to students in two high schools. We fund all materials that we use for these lessons. Your donations lets us provide:<p>

			<h2>What PiE can do for you</h2>
			<div class="col-md-7">
				<div class="inner">
					<p>As PiE is an organization with close ties to Tau Beta Pi, the staff and faculty of the College of Engineering, engineering honor societies, and about 27,000 undergraduate students at UC Berkeley, your support of the program is extremely visible to the community at and around UC Berkeley.</p>

					<p>We appreciate and recognize our sponsors in the form of posters, banners and logos, and t-shirts seen by thousands of members of the UC Berkeley community. In addition, sponsors are warmly welcomed and encouraged to attend the competition day.</p>
