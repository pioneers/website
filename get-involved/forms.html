<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to Pioneers in Engineering! To get you up and running, we'll need
    you to fill out a few forms.
    You can find them all in the link below as part of a Cognito Forms document. <br>
    <br>
    
    <h2 align="center"><a href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/PioneersInEngineering/NewStaffRegistration" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-file" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        CognitoForms electronic signatures</a></h2> 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you're not comfortable submitting your signature online,
    feel free to print out the forms instead; there should be links to PDFs in the CognitoForm.</p>
<div class="container-fluid"></div>
<br>
<p>
    Once you complete those, contact <a href="mailto:recruiting@pioneers.berkeley.edu">recruiting@pioneers.berkeley.edu</a> so we can process your paperwork.
