    <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>Successful teams should fulfill these basic requirements.
			Your team must:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Be able to meet multiple times per week, and at least two hours a week with your mentor</strong>.
          <p>Building robots is no walk in the park, and it takes much longer than you think to get things working! Our most successful teams often meet 15 hours or more per week.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attend Kickoff, Game Day, Design Reviews, Scrimmage, and Final Competition</strong>.
          <p>Dates for these events are listed below.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Send weekly updates on your progress</strong>.
          <p>It is important for us to know how you’re doing. Plus, good engineers always document their work.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Have access to a computer with internet</strong>.
          <p>We send out weekly updates with important information over email. You will also need a computer to be able to program your robot.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
