# Become a Mentor
If you are a UC Berkeley or SFSU student, you can be a great PiE mentor! Mentors are required to take our DeCal (2 units, P/NP) and mentor their teams for at least two hours per week.  Mentors are currently needed for the Robotics Competition during the Spring.

# Who is a Mentor?
A Pioneers in Engineering mentor for the Robotics Competition guides a team of local high school students through the design and build process of a robot that will compete in an eight-week long, exciting competition season. Our mentors are mostly UC Berkeley students, but we also have mentors from the City College of SF and other volunteers in the community.

# Why Mentor for PiE
1. Opportunity to learn more about robotics, mechanical design, and electrical design
2. Gain first-hand experience in teaching and hands-on engineering
3. Inspire high school students to pursue science and technical fields in higher education
4. Make an impact on the local community
5. Earn units in our DeCal class
