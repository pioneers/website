# Inspire high school students through STEM

Become a mentor for a high school robotics team. Be a role model for local students as you guide them in building a robot for PiE's Robotics Competition. Through our class, you'll learn what you need to know to be a mentor and help build the robot.

Find out more at our info sessions:
- Monday 1/22 6:30 - 7:30 PM, 220 Jacobs Hall
- Thursday 1/25 6:30 - 7:30 PM, 210 Jacobs Hall
