    <p>Want to help out? Here at PiE, we don't have an application process. Rather, we firmly believe that any UC Berkeley student who is interested in our club has something to offer, whether community-wise, project-wise, or anything else that we can't think of ourselves! Simply fill out the forms or come check out worksession and we'll get you started!<p>

<!--
Are you interested in joining the more than 80 active staff members of PiE? We currently have [over 20 different projects](../get-involved/faq.html#projects) for you to get involved in. Pioneers in Engineering is an excellent way to get involved in outreach through engineering - your work in PiE will reach hundreds of Bay Area high school students. Our organization is entirely student run and depends on the efforts and contributions of students like you.


If you’re looking to get involved, or just want more information about us, shoot an email to <a href="mailto:recruiting@pioneers.berkeley.edu">recruiting@pioneers.berkeley.edu</a> or fill out [this interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yiyzjsyio_bC4FRvGLdYg7EoBzHKdJ4ZJYyrRlnuTOM/viewform) to join our mailing list! You can also drop by our weekly work sessions - catch us in the 3rd Floor O’Brien Breezeway (the glass hallway between McLaughlin and O’Brien) on Wednesdays from 7-9 PM and Saturdays from 1-3 PM, starting September 12.

<h1>Other Student Groups on Campus</h1>

Berkeley has lots of other student groups related to engineering or community outreach - here’s a small selection below!

<h1>Robotics@Berkeley</h1>
Robotics@Berkeley is a student group committed to lowering the barriers to starting robotics projects and joining the robotics community at Cal. They strive to create a financial, social, and informational hub for undergraduate roboticists at UC Berkeley by:

1. Providing monetary, informational, and administrative support for students’ robotics-related projects and competition teams,
2. Collecting and publicizing information about and opportunities in UC Berkeley’s robotics-related student groups and research labs, and
3. Organizing socially and intellectually engaging events for roboticists of all ages, majors, and interests.

You can check out more about their group on their website [here](https://rab.berkeley.edu), along with a list of other robotics organizations they list [here](https://rab.berkeley.edu/related/clubs).
