## PiE's Open Source policy 
This page will explain in plain language what PiE (Pioneers in Engineering) does to your, a contributor's, rights to the work you create in your time as a PiE staff. This page will detail the type of licenses [PiE Foundation]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/foundation.html) will apply to the different type of work you can be contributing, so that you can make informed decisions on whether you want to become a PiE staff contributor.

It is important for you to agree to this policy, through the signing of the Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA), because otherwise, PiE cannot use any of your contributions and will regretfully be unable to allow you to be a part of PiE staff.

## Scope
Upon signing of the Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA), '''all work generated''' by you as a contributor is subjected to the terms of the ICLA.

## Individual Contributor License Agreements (ICLAs) 
The ICLA is (most likely) the document that referred you to this page. The ICLA, in simple terms, grants PIE Foundation a license to the work generated by you as a contributor. It enables you, the contributor, to retain the ultimate copyrights to work, but licenses PiE Foundation the right to use your work as a part of its mission.

The signing of the ICLA is a **precondition** for you to become a PiE staff contributor and to receive a pioneers account.
