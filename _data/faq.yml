- question: I missed infosession! Is it too late?
  answer: Absolutely not! You can see <a href="/assets/faq/fall-infosession-2016.pdf">the slides from our infosession here</a>, and read through this page for some basic info about Pioneers in Engineering.

- question: How do I join? Do I have to apply?
  answer: There is no application to get involved with Pioneers in Engineering. We do have a few forms for you to fill out, which you can <a href="/get-involved/forms.html">view here</a>. However, these forms are not an application - they're for you to set up your PiE account and start doing cool stuff with us! You can drop off these forms at one of our worksessions, or pick up pre-printed copies there.

- question: Do I have to be an engineering major to join?
  answer:  Nope! Plenty of PiE staff are non-engineers - we have Computer Science majors, Cognitive Science majors, Biology majors, Econ majors, and more! We encourage people to explore projects that aren't necessarily related to their field of study.

- question: When/where does PiE meet?
  answer: Our worksessions are every Wednesday from 7 - 9 PM and every Saturday from 1 - 3 PM. We meet in O'Brien Hall - typically in 212 O'Brien or the Breezeway. You can also frequently find us in our clubroom, 101 O'Brien, whether or not we have worksession. 101 can be a little tricky to find the first time around - let us know if you need help! <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1Sd6QurpSJK3xXEvOiISkWlKXj98" height="480" style="width:100%" ></iframe>
