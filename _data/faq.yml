- question: I missed infosession! Is it too late?
  answer: Absolutely not! You can see <a href="/assets/faq/fall-infosession-2016.pdf">the slides from our infosession here</a>, and read through this page for some basic info about Pioneers in Engineering.

- question: How do I join? Do I have to apply?
  answer: There is no application to get involved with Pioneers in Engineering. We do have a few forms for you to fill out, which you can <a href="/get-involved/forms.html">view here</a>. However, these forms are not an application - they're for you to set up your PiE account and start doing cool stuff with us! You can drop off these forms at one of our worksessions, or pick up pre-printed copies there.

- question: Do I have to be an engineering major to join?
  answer:  Nope! Plenty of PiE staff are non-engineers - we have Computer Science majors, Cognitive Science majors, Biology majors, Econ majors, and more! We encourage people to explore projects that aren't necessarily related to their field of study.

- question: What if I don't show up to every worksession?
  answer: PiE members help out on a volunter basis. We don't expect you to always show up nor will we disqualify you. Help out when you can, wherever you can. However, if you agree to do a time-sensitive task, please try to complete the task promptly, or talk to your PM about reassigning it.

- question: What if I'm not qualified to contribute to the project I'm interested in?
  answer: PiE is one of those clubs that frankly don't care who you are, how cool you are, what your GPA is, nor what your qualifications are. We are open to training and assisting anyone who is willing to help and to learn. If you think you are struggling to learn the skills needed or to commit enough time, talk to your PM about it for advice, or talk to leadership about it. There is always a need for more people who are willing to serve.

- question: What needs does PiE have?
  answer: A lot, and when considering the possibilities, countless. PiE, in whatever project, event, or any other scenario, always has a need waiting to be filled. Again, it doesn't matter what you know; we'll train you and offer guidance. Read our project descriptions for exciting work that could expand the impact PiE has.

- question: Can I bring up new ideas? I don't know if my ideas would be considered important-er than the ones currently being worked on.
  answer: First off, leadership will not judge you for your ideas. Your ideas will be appreciated and possibly even supported. PiE is an organization that can only grow if we have new ideas, new people, new vision.

- question: When/where does PiE meet?
  answer: Our worksessions are every Wednesday from 7 - 9 PM and every Saturday from 1 - 3 PM. We meet in O'Brien Hall - typically in 212 O'Brien or the Breezeway. You can also frequently find us in our clubroom, 101 O'Brien, whether or not we have worksession. 101 can be a little tricky to find the first time around - let us know if you need help! <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1Sd6QurpSJK3xXEvOiISkWlKXj98" height="480" style="width:100%" ></iframe>
