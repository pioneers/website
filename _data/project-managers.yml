    bio: 'I''m the chief table architect of 101, so if you want to complain about how dumb the table arrangement is while someone cackles maniacally, you can just find me.  If you''re more interested in reading self-referential bios that contain exactly three hundred two characters, I can also help you with that.'

    project: Shepherd
    description: 'Shepherd is a coding project that is instrumental to every PiE competition. We call ourselves Shepherd because we shepherd all the parts of the field and, more importantly, so we can eat shepherd''s pie. At competitions, everything that happens on the game field ends up going through shepherd, so if we don’t have our stuff together, nothing is going to work.'
    bio: "I am a second year EECS major, and my favorite class so far has been CS61B. I like video/board games, hiking, and skiing.\nRobots are fun too :)"

    project: Shepherd
    description: Shepherd is the field control software that serves as the conductor of PiE competitions. On a high level, it interfaces with different sources of information, processes it at a central location, and sends commands back to wherever is necessary. These sources of information include field elements such as the scoreboard, sensors, user inputs, and the robots themselves. Shepherd also encompasses student and staff UIs, through which each match at the final competition is started and run, and the scoreboard.
    bio: 'Hi! I''m a second year EECS major. Things I enjoy include esports, teaching, and Shepherd''s pie. Things I don''t enjoy include writing bios.'

    project: Game Design Committee
    description: 'Game Design Committee is exactly as it sounds -- we design the game for PiE''s annual robotics competition. As essentially the backbone of PiE, what we design determines what many of the other projects work on throughout the year. We strive to create a fair, challenging, but fun game for students that will be fun for staff to work on as well!'
    bio: I once faked an admission letter to Hamburger University. Feel free to talk to me about Guy Fieri, chicken nuggets, and memes.

    description: 'PiEDB is part of PiE Electrical Team, which works with Power Distribution Board (PDB). PDB is relatively simple circuits board, that performs two main functions: power distribution and battery cell voltage display. The reason why PDB has entire team dedicated to it, is difficulty of power electronics. Currently, we mostly focused on optimisation of PDB's design, derived by previous iterations of our team.'
