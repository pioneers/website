    Project: Hibike/Runtime
    Project Description: 'We write the code that runs on the students'' robots, relaying the signals sent by the student on their controllers to the servos, motors, and sensors on the robots. This project is all about the low-level machinery that makes the robots work!'
    Short Bio:: 'Hey guys! I''m a sophomore studying EECS and/or ME, and I grew up here in the Bay. I want to go into clean energy and clean transportation in the future. In my spare time, I like speedcubing, learning about astronomy, taking pictures, and making tutorials. I''m in the Yali''s in Sutarja Dai for a couple hours every day, you can come find me there, I''m down to chat about anything!'

    Project: Atlas
    Project Description: Join in on tasks like field construction and being a referee. The highlights of Game Implementation are the ease of joining and the large impact we cause. All you need to bring is time to invest and we’ll get you working on projects that are fundamental to the competition. Your handiwork will even be displayed and used by all the high school students.
    Short Bio:: "I am the second best melee player in PiE. I don't actually live in 101 ok. My snapchat name is a nickname from my freshman year of high school. I think I study math but I'm not even sure anymore. I hope to graduate in 2020.\n\nI built the brown stained table in 101. I feel cool thanks for asking. "

    Project: Education
    Project Description: Education focuses on teaching workshops at events for students and teaching a DeCal for mentors in the Spring! We also have a fall project called PRB (Pie on the Road), where we make a smaller robot kit and bring it out to non-pie schools to spark interest in PiE or robotics in general. Our workshops vary from technical workshops like PiE API and Game Management to non-technical workshops like the Diversity workshop. DeCal is probably our biggest time commitment, as we run weekly classes and work on improving our curriculum. Education is a great project for learning about all the aspects in PiE and really connecting with the students and mentors!
    Short Bio:: 'I''m a sophomore and an intended Psychology major. I joined PiE last year, and I was also a PiE student in high school (Go PV!). I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and I have way too many stuffed animals. '

    Name: Kaitlyn Chan
    Project: PiE Sens
    Project Description: PiE Sens is one of the two projects in PiE Electrical. Members of the team go through an iterative design process to put together our electrical system. The staff goes through a brainstorming phase to collect ideas on what sensors are required for the game. Then, the sensors are prototyped and then translated into a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). We teach the staff how to use industry level PCB software to route our boards before having our sponsors send us the completed boards. We then manufacture the boards in house to test and revise.
    Short Bio:: I am currently a sophomore in EECS. I like robots, cats, and anime. Feel free to email me at kaitlynjchan@berkeley.edu with any questions! :)

    Project: Shepherd
    Project Description: 'Shepherd is a coding project that is instrumental to every PiE competition. We call ourselves Shepherd because we shepherd all the parts of the field and, more importantly, so we can eat shepherd''s pie. At competitions, everything that happens on the game field ends up going through Shepherd, so if we don''t have our stuff together, nothing is going to work. :'')'
    Short Bio:: 'Hi, I''m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science! I came for the free pie, stayed for the fun times. Programming and robots are cool too I guess.'
