    bio: "Bryant lived a fairly ordinary life, but that all changed one night when, while walking home from the cinema, he witnessed his own parents being murdered in front of his very eyes. From then on, he swore he would protect his city and its citizens so no one would have to suffer as he did. He would save his city. \n\nHowever, he recognized that, as a man, he was flesh and blood: he could be ignored, he could be destroyed; but as a symbol... as a symbol he could be incorruptible, he could be everlasting. To do that, he had to become someone else. He had to become something else.\n\nBut then he got accepted into Berkeley, so he scrapped those plans and now he's studying engineering."
