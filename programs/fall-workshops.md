Are you interested in developing your skills in building and designing?

Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) is launching a new series of monthly workshops for local high school students in September, October and November.

## Exploring Engineering with PiE  
December 3, 9:45 am - 3 pm

We proudly present our third, and final, workshop for this year! Exploring Engineering with PiE will give students the opportunity to see what UC Berkeley students and staff in engineering do on campus. If you are not sure whether you want to pursue engineering as a career, no worries! Not all PiE staff are engineering majors and we will be more than happy to talk to you about what life as a UC Berkeley student is like.

Some of the day's activities include 3D modeling/printing and a tour of a lab, as well as hands-on activities throughout the day. You are more than welcome to attend, even if you have not participated in our previous workshops.

This workshop will be on December 3rd from 9:45 am - 3 pm on the UC Berkeley campus. Please arrive at the Hearst Mining Circle on the UC Berkeley campus by 9:45! You must [register](/programs/fall-workshops-registration.html) to attend. **SIGNUPS CLOSE Wednesday, November 30th, 11:59 PM.** You CANNOT register after this time due to the fact that we have to order materials. Thank you for understanding.

### FAQS:

**Will lunch be provided?**

**I don't have a lot of experience. Will that make the workshop too difficult for me?**

No, our goal is to introduce basic engineering skills so we will take your experience level into consideration with the workshop. PiE staff will be mentoring students and will provide extra assistance if needed.

**Do we have to bring anything?**

Only lunch money/packed lunch and your printed and signed liability waiver, if you did not provide a signature on the online registration form.

**Will transportation be provided?**

No, please make your own arrangements for transportation.


## Creating Code with PiE
PiE hosted its second workshop at UC Berkeley on Saturday, September 29th from 10 AM to 3:00 PM in Soda Hall. While our workshop is intended for students with no programming experience, students from all backgrounds and experiences are appreciated and very welcome! At this workshop, students learned about basic programming logic, variables, conditionals and loops, functions, and get a taste of recursion -- all in Scratch! All computers were provided.

## Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering

The first in our series of Fall Workshops, Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering took place on campus on Saturday, September 24th from 9:45 AM to 3:00 PM in O'Brien Breezeway. Students from all backgrounds and experiences had tool training, learned about prototyping, design, and participated in designing and constructing their own bridge.
