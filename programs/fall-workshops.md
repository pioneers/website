Are you interested in developing your skills in building and designing?

Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) is launching a new series of monthly workshops for local high school students in September, October and November.

## Exploring Engineering with PiE

We proudly present our third, and final, workshop for this year! Exploring Engineering with PiE will give students the opportunity to see what UC Berkeley students and staff in engineering do on campus, and if you are not sure whether or not you want to pursue engineering as a career, no worries! Not all PiE staff are engineering majors and we will be more than happy to talk to you about what life as a UC Berkeley student is like.

Some of the day's activities include 3D modeling/printing and a tour of lab, and there will be hands-on activities throughout the day You are more than welcome to attend, even if you have not participated in our previous workshops.

This workshop will be on December 3rd from 9:45 am - 3 pm on UC Berkeley campus. Please arrive to the Hearst Mining Circle on UC Berkeley campus by 9:45! You must [register](/programs/fall-workshops-registration.html) to attend. **SIGNUPS CLOSE Sunday, November 27th, 8 AM.** You CANNOT register after this time due to the fact that we have to order materials. Thank you for understanding.

Only lunch money/packed lunch and your printed and signed liability waiver, if you did not provide a signature on the online registration form.

## Creating Code with PiE
PiE hosted its second workshop at UC Berkeley on Saturday, September 29th from 10 AM to 3:00 PM in Soda Hall. While our workshop is intended for students with no programming experience, students from all backgrounds and experiences are appreciated and very welcome! At this workshop, students learned about basic programming logic, variables, conditionals and loops, functions, and get a taste of recursion -- all in Scratch! All computers were provided.

## Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering

The first in our series of Fall Workshops, Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering took place on campus on Saturday, September 24th from 9:45 AM to 3:00 PM in O'Brien Breezeway. Students from all backgrounds and experiences had tool training, learned about prototyping, design, and participated in designing and constructing their own bridge.
