# Fall 2016 Workshops

## Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering

The first in our series of Fall Workshops, Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering took place on campus on Saturday, September 24th from 9:45 AM to 3:00 PM in O'Brien Breezeway. Students from all backgrounds and experiences had tool training, learned about prototyping, design, and participated in designing and constructing their own bridge.

## Creating Code with PiE
PiE hosted its second workshop at UC Berkeley on Saturday, September 29th from 10 AM to 3:00 PM in Soda Hall. While our workshop is intended for students with no programming experience, students from all backgrounds and experiences are appreciated and very welcome! At this workshop, students learned about basic programming logic, variables, conditionals and loops, functions, and get a taste of recursion -- all in Scratch! All computers were provided.

# PREP

PREP was PiEâ€™s Fall mentorship program. It spanned from September through the first four weeks of the Spring semester, just prior to competition season. This program aimed to spark underserved high school students' interest in STEM and to provide them with mentors to nurture this interest further. We achieved this ambitious goal with cool projects like hovercrafts, marshmallow trebuchets, and robotic arms.

In addition to this gentle introduction to STEM, PREP also tried to inspire the students to pursue higher education. We organized a student field trip to the UC Berkeley campus and hosted Q&A sessions with current undergraduates.

In 2015, the participating schools in the PiE PREP Program are Ralph Bunche High School, Middle College High School, and Community Day School in Oakland. PREP piloted at Ralph Bunche two years ago with much success, and since then we have grown a lot.
