# Pioneers in Engineering Alumni Scholarship
Pioneers in Engineering strives to provide a quality STEM educational experience for Bay Area high school students. In keeping with our mission to promote science and engineering, we are happy to announce our fourth annual PiE alumni-funded scholarship for PiE students. The scholarship will be for a one-time amount of $2000.

The scholarship committee will review each application holistically, taking into account academic achievement, extracurricular activities, leadership skills, and passion. As a STEM organization, we are especially interested in how your pursuits involve science and engineering.
