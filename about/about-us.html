		<p>Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) promotes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education through an exciting, mentorship-based process. PiE is a student outreach organization based in UC Berkeley and was founded in 2008 by members of Tau Beta Pi led by Xiao-Yu Fu. We strongly believe that no student should be denied a quality STEM education experience.

				<h3>FALL</h3>
				<p>In the fall, PiE hosts a reboot of our competition from the previous spring. Students have the chance to hone and refine their ideas from the earlier competition, using the robots that they've already built. The competition also includes design challenges that emphasize various aspects of robotics. We also participate in a number of outreach events, such as the Bay Area Science Festival, events with the Lawrence Hall of Science, and Mini Maker Faire.</p>

				<h3>SPRING</h3>
				<p>Every Spring high school teams from all over the East Bay and San Francisco face off in a challenging, exciting, and educational robotics experience crafted by PiE. The competition runs from late February to April and is hosted entirely by UC Berkeley students: we build our own robotics kit for every team, we mentor the teams, we design and build the competition field, and we fundraise more than $30,000 each year to make this all possible.</p>
